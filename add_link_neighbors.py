# The `add_link_neighbors` function in Python is designed to add neighbor information to each link in a graph.
# It takes in one parameter: `links`, which is a list of link objects.
# Each link object is assumed to have at least two attributes: `o_node` (origin node) and `d_node` (destination node).

# The function starts by extracting all origin nodes and destination nodes from the `links` list
# and storing them in `all_o_nodes` and `all_d_nodes` respectively.
# It then sorts these lists and stores the sorted lists and their original indices in `all_o_nodes_sorted`,
# `sortOInds`, `all_d_nodes_sorted`, and `sortDInds`.

# The function then enters a loop that iterates over each link in `links`.
# For each link, it initializes an empty list `link.neighbors` to store the IDs of the link's neighbors.
# It then finds the indices of the link's origin and destination nodes in `all_o_nodes_sorted` and `all_d_nodes_sorted`
# using the `ismember1D` function. These indices are stored in `oo_inds`, `do_inds`, `od_inds`, and `dd_inds`.

# The function then creates a list `all_ids` that contains all these indices
# and removes duplicate indices from `all_ids` to create `unique_ids`.
# If `unique_ids` is not empty, the function enters another loop that iterates over each index in `unique_ids`.
# For each index, if it is not the same as the current link's index and it is not 0,
# the function adds the ID of the link at this index to `link.neighbors`.   # this id should be the actual node id not the enumerate bs there is now!

# Finally, the function returns the updated `links` list.
# In summary, this function adds neighbor information to each link in a graph
# by finding the links that have the same origin or destination node as the current link
# and adding their IDs to the current link's `neighbors` attribute.
